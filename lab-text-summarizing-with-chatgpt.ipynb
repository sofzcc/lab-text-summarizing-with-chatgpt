        "I wanted a fountain for 2 main reasons. Our 11 year old diabetic dog, who is also now blind, has dental problems. We were told years ago not to put him under anesthesia to have his teeth cleaned so you can imagine... Water is so important for him and he drank a lot. We would fill his bowl 3 times a day and would have to clean it out well each time as there would be sediment in it. I am assuming it could be from his teeth. Plus, we had just gotten 2 kittens. I didn't think it was healthy for any of them to be drinking with the sediment in the bowl as I was afraid of infection passing from one to the others or continuing an infection. The reason I hadn't gotten one sooner was that our house, built in 1950 in a rural area only had 1 outlet in each room, so there was nowhere to plug one in and the very few wireless ones were just cost prohibitive. Finally, the prices have become more reasonable. I did a lot of research. I definitely wanted good filters (that didn't cost an arm and a leg), and one big enough for all of the furries. I purchased this one with the idea that we would try it and if it didn't clear the water sufficiently, if it was too shallow for the dog, or if they wouldn't use it, I would return it.\n",
        "We've had it and been using it for a few weeks now. (We still leave 2 other bowls out at different places in the house and on the porch so that there was plenty of water available. While they occasionally drink out of one of the plain stainless bowls occasionally and the dog drinks from the bowl on the porch when he is outside, they all 3 very much prefer the fountain. We have to check it every 2-3 days (yes, he drinks that much water) and change the filters about every 3 weeks but the water that comes into the top stays clean and clear. We've noticed that the dogs teeth seem to be doing better. We cannot hear it unless the water gets low or the filters need changed. The motion sensors work perfectly and since it's in a fairly high traffic area it goes on enough that I haven't had to run it intermittently.\n",

They're cute, really nicely made, but when I say do not even think about using metal utensils in these I mean it. It doesn't bother me all that much but after cooking one time and GENTLY using a metal fork in the skillet it's scratched in several spots. Also, they CAN be easy to clean - but it really depends. I use the sprayer on the sink as soon as I'm finished using a dish to hose it off and keep things from getting stuck to it, but some things do still stick on unfortunately.

Good examples also help a reader to quickly ramp up his/her knowledge and skills in whatever learned and apply to solving real problems.
